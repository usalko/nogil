Overview
-------------------

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of CPython that supports multithreading without the global interpreter lock (GIL). An overview of the  design is described in the `Python Multithreading without GIL <https://docs.google.com/document/d/18CXhDb1ygxg-YXNBJNzfzZsDFosB5e6BfnXLlejd9l0/edit>`__ Google doc.


Installation from source
-------------------

The proof-of-concept works best on Linux x86-64. It also builds on Linux ARM64, Windows (64-bit), and macOS, but you will have to recompile extension modules yourself for these platforms.

The build process has not changed from upstream CPython. See https://devguide.python.org/ for instructions on how to build from source, or follow the steps below.

Install::

    ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX] [--enable-optimizations]
    make -j
    make install
    
The optional ``--prefix=PREFIX`` specifies the destination directory for the Python installation. The optional ``--enable-optimizations`` enables profile guided optimizations (PGO). This slows down the build process, but makes the compiled Python a bit faster.

Docker
-------------------

A pre-built Docker image `nogil/python <https://hub.docker.com/r/nogil/python>`_ is available on Docker Hub. For CUDA support, use  `nogil/python-cuda <https://hub.docker.com/r/nogil/python-cuda>`_.

Packages
-------------------

Use ``pip install <package>`` as usual to install packages. Please file an issue if you are unable to install a pip package you would like to use.

The proof-of-concept comes with a modified bundled "pip" that includes an `alternative package index <https://d1yxz45j0ypngg.cloudfront.net/>`_. The alternative package index includes C extensions that are either slow to build from source or require some modifications for compatibility.


GIL control
-------------------

The GIL is disabled by default, but if you wish, you can enable it at runtime using the environment variable ``PYTHONGIL=1``. You can check if the GIL is disabled from Python by accessing ``sys.flags.nogil``::

    python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.flags.nogil)"  # True
    PYTHONGIL=1 python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.flags.nogil)"  # False

Example
-------------------

You can use the existing Python APIs, such as the `threading <https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html>`_ module and the  `ThreadPoolExecutor <https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor>`_ class.

Here is an example based on Larry Hastings's `Gilectomy benchmark <https://github.com/larryhastings/gilectomy/blob/gilectomy/x.py>`_::

    import sys
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

    print(f"nogil={getattr(sys.flags, 'nogil', False)}")

    def fib(n):
        if n < 2: return 1
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

    threads = 8
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        threads = int(sys.argv[1])

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=threads) as executor:
        for _ in range(threads):
            executor.submit(lambda: print(fib(34)))

Run it with, e.g.::

    time python3 fib.py 1   # 1 thread, 1x work
    time python3 fib.py 20  # 20 threads, 20x work
    
The program parallelizes well up to the number of available cores. On a 20 core Intel Xeon E5-2698 v4  one thread takes 1.50 seconds and 20 threads take 1.52 seconds [1].

[1] Turbo boost was `disabled <https://askubuntu.com/questions/619875/disabling-intel-turbo-boost-in-ubuntu>`_ to measure the scaling of the program without the effects of CPU frequency scaling. Additionally, you may get more reliable measurements by using `taskset <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/taskset.1.html>`_ to avoid virtual "hyperthreading" cores.
